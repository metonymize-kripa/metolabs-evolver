Create a comprehensive calculator library with the following requirements:

FUNCTIONALITY:
1. Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
2. Division must handle division by zero gracefully with Result<f64, String>
3. Support for chaining operations (e.g., Calculator::new().add(5).multiply(2).result())
4. Memory functions (store, recall, clear)
5. Percentage calculations

ERROR HANDLING:
- All operations that can fail must return Result types
- Provide clear, descriptive error messages
- Handle edge cases: NaN, infinity, overflow

CODE QUALITY:
- Full documentation with examples for all public APIs
- Follow Rust best practices (no unwrap in production code)
- Implement Display trait for user-friendly output
- Use builder pattern for operation chaining

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Test all basic operations with normal inputs
- Test edge cases: zero, negative numbers, very large numbers
- Test error conditions: division by zero, invalid operations
- Test operation chaining
- Test memory functions
- Aim for >90% code coverage
